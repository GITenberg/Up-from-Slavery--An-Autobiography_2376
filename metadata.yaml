description: "Up from Slavery is the 1901 autobiography of Booker T. Washington detailing\
  \ his personal experiences in working to rise from the position of a slave child\
  \ during the Civil War, to the difficulties and obstacles he overcame to get an\
  \ education at the new Hampton University, to his work establishing vocational schools—most\
  \ notably the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama—to help black people and other disadvantaged\
  \ minorities learn useful, marketable skills and work to pull themselves, as a race,\
  \ up by the bootstraps. He reflects on the generosity of both teachers and philanthropists\
  \ who helped in educating blacks and Native Americans. He describes his efforts\
  \ to instill manners, breeding, health and a feeling of dignity to students. His\
  \ educational philosophy stresses combining academic subjects with learning a trade\
  \ (something which is reminiscent of the educational theories of John Ruskin). Washington\
  \ explained that the integration of practical subjects is partly designed to reassure\
  \ the white community as to the usefulness of educating black people.\nThis book\
  \ was first released as a serialized work in 1900 through The Outlook, a Christian\
  \ newspaper of New York. This work was serialized because this meant that during\
  \ the writing process, Washington was able to hear critiques and requests from his\
  \ audience and could more easily adapt his paper to his diverse audience.\n\nWashington\
  \ was a controversial figure in his own lifetime, and W. E. B. Du Bois, among others,\
  \ criticized some of his views. The book was, however, a best-seller, and remained\
  \ the most popular African American autobiography until that of Malcolm X. In 1998,\
  \ the Modern Library listed the book at No. 3 on its list of the 100 best nonfiction\
  \ books of the 20th century.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
